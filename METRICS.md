# TITAN telemetry semantics

TITAN's telemetry mixes direct signal measurements with control heuristics and
artistic interpretation. The distinction matters when comparing experiments.

## Measurements and estimators

- `sigma` is a mean-centered, multi-lag propagation-slope estimate over recent
  movement. It is not a literal physical branching ratio. Its accompanying
  `criticality_confidence` discounts low-variance, non-stationary, short, or
  cross-lag-inconsistent windows.
- `phi` is a bounded audio-structure proxy derived from observable signal
  statistics. It is not Integrated Information Theory's Phi.
- `pi_proxy` summarizes multi-lag predictive structure. It is not causal proof
  of information integration.
- `empowerment` is a transition-variance heuristic coupled to movement. It is
  not channel-capacity empowerment.
- `novelty_dmin` is distance to recent, level-normalized log-spectral shapes.
  It detects timbral change, not semantic or compositional novelty.

## Controllers

- `V` is a designed control potential over operating-state summaries, not
  thermodynamic free energy.
- `temp` controls perturbation, plasticity, and exploration. It is an adaptive
  control variable, not physical temperature.
- `energy` is a bounded synthesis/control budget.

Claims about improved sound should be supported by repeated seeded runs,
ablation comparisons, objective audio measurements, and blinded listening—not
by these internal metrics alone.
